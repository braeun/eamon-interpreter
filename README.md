# Eamon Interpreter

Eamon Interpreter is an attempt to provide an environment in which to run 
original Apple II eamon games on a modern system without the need of a full
fledged Apple II emulator.

## Obtaining Games

Eamon games distributed on Apple II Dos 3.3 disk images can be obtained from 
http://www.eamonag.org/ which contains a lot of information about Eamon. Especially
look at the download page http://www.eamonag.org/lists/list-download.htm.

Eamon Interpreter uses some third party code:

* JSON for Modern C++ by Niels Lohmann (https://github.com/nlohmann/json) 
  which is licensed  under the MIT license
  
* Qt toolkit licensed under the GNU General Public License version 3

The code of the first eamon game (beginners cave and main hall) is included
in the source tree. I am not really sure about the license but it states on
the game image that non-commercial distribution is welcome.


## Thanks

* Robert Green, main author of AppleCommander, and contributors for the clean 
  Java code providing much insight into the Dos 3.3 disk and file structure.
